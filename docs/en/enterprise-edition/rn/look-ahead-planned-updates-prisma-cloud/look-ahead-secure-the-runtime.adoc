//TODO: Require a confirmation from Tal to add the blurb in 32.04 release.
// | *Enhanced Vulnerability Assessment*
// | NVD utilizes the 'Running On/With' configuration, which combines nodes based on both vulnerable and non-vulnerable match criteria. This configuration specifies that for a vulnerability to apply, specific criteria must be met, such as packages or operating systems. Prisma Cloud now supports vulnerability assessment based on the 'Running On/With' configuration. This enhancement may result in a more accurate assessment of vulnerabilities, as Prisma Cloud now evaluates previously unassessed 'Running On/With' configurations.

//CWP-56798 [Doc Ticket]CWP-44076[Eng Ticket]
|*Blobstore Scanning Defender Upgrade for Tanzu Customers*
|Enhanced the existing blobstore scanning feature for Tanzu customers. As a part of this enhancement, existing blobstore scanning defenders  will now appear disconnected and new defender instances will be automatically created to replace them. The disconnected blobstore will disappear after 24 hours as part of the retention process. This upgrade excludes Linux and Windows defenders (Full coverage defenders).
If you have configured blobstore scanning and assigned it to a specific blobstore defender after the release of 32.04, you are required to manually edit the configurations and change it to a newly created blobstore defender scanner. This release will also introduce a new tile support - Jimmy for TAS.
